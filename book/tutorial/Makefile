# Definition of F* flags

FSTAR_HINTS ?= --use_hints --use_hint_hashes --record_hints

# This flag controls what gets extracted to OCaml. Generally, we don't extract
# the FStar namespace since it's already extracted and packaged as the ocamlfind
# package fstarlib. Here, unlike in -bundle, +Spec matches both Spec and
# Spec.*
FSTAR_EXTRACT = --extract 'OCaml:-* +Spec'

# Some reasonable flags to turn on:
# - 247: checked file not written because some of its dependencies...
# - 285: missing or file not found, almost always something to act on
# - 241: stale dependencies, almost always a sign that the build is incorrect
#
# But also:
# - --cmi, for cross-module inlining, a must-have for anyone who relies on
#   inline_for_extraction in the presence of interfaces
# - --cache_checked_modules to rely on a pre-built ulib and krmllib
# - --cache_dir, to avoid polluting our generated build artifacts outside o

# Initial dependency analysis
# ---------------------------

# Important to wildcard both fst and fsti since there are fstis without fsts,

# fancy globbing rules -- particularly true on Windows.

# This is the only bulletproof way that I know of forcing a regeneration of the
# .depend file every single time. Why, you may ask? Well, it's frequent enough
# to add a new file that you don't want to decipher a cryptic error only to
# remember you should run `make depend`. Also, if you move files around, it's
# good to force regeneration even though .depend may be more recent than the
# mtime of the moved files.

# Verification
# ------------

# Everest-specific idiom: all makefiles accept OTHERFLAGS, for instance, if one
# wants to rebuild with OTHERFLAGS="--admit_smt_queries true". We just don't
# pass such flags to the dependency analysis.

# Creating these directories via a make rule, rather than rely on F* creating
# them, as two calls to F* might race.

	mkdir $@

# We allow some specific pattern rules to be added here, relying on the shortest
# stem rule for them to take precedence. For instance, you may want to do:
#
# obj/Bignum.Impl.fst.checked: FSTAR_FLAGS = "--query_stats"
#
# (Note: for options that control the SMT encoding, such as
# --smtencoding.nl_arith_repr native, please make sure you also define them in
# Makefile.common for %.fst-in otherwise you'll observe different behaviors
# between interactive and batch modes.)
#
# By default, however, variables are inherited through the dependencies, meaning
# that the example above would normally set these FSTAR_FLAGS for any .checked
# that is rebuilt because it's a dependency of Bignum.Impl.fst.checked.
#
# To avoid this unpleasant behavior, the most general pattern rule (longest
# stem) also defines a suitable default value for FSTAR_FLAGS.
%.checked: FSTAR_FLAGS=

# Note: F* will not change the mtime of a checked file if it is
# up-to-date (checksum matches, file unchanged), but this will confuse
# make and result in endless rebuilds. So, we touch that file.

# Extraction
# ----------

# A few mismatches here between the dependencies present in the .depend and the
# expected F* invocation. In .depend:
#
# obj/Bignum_Impl.ml: obj/Bignum.Impl.fst.checked ... more dependencies ...
#
# But F* wants (remember that F* searches for source files anywhere on the
# include path):
#
# fstar Bignum.Impl.fst --extract_module BigNum.Impl
#
# We use basename because we may also extract krml files from .fsti.checked
# files (not true for OCaml, we don't extract mlis from fstis).

# This is now the preferred and recommended way to compile C code with KaRaMeL.
#
# KaRaMeL (via -skip-compilation) only generates a stub Makefile in dist/,
# instead of acting as a C compilation driver like it did before. The Makefile
# that is generated by KaRaMeL is basic, but takes into account:
# - the -o option to determine what is being built
# - the C files passed on the command line, which will be linked together
# - C compiler flags passed to KaRaMeL via -ccopts
#
# This Makefile is called Makefile.basic and should be enough for all your basic
# needs. If you need something more fancy, you can easily author your own custom
# dist/Makefile, which includes Makefile.basic, then proceeds to redefine /
# tweak some variables.
#
# Note that you are of course more than welcome to define your own
# CMakeLists.txt or whatever your favorite build system is: this tutorial only
# describes the supported canonical way of compiling code.
#
# See the advanced topics section for an in-depth explanation of how the -bundle
# option works. We also use -minimal.

# Compiling the generated C code
# ------------------------------

# Here we do a recursive make invocation because a new dependency analysis needs
# to be performed on the generated C files. This recursive make deals with all
# the files copied in dist, which includes karamel-generated and hand-written,
# copied files from HAND_WRITTEN_C_FILES.

# Compiling the generated OCaml code
# ----------------------------------

# This is much more difficult, and you're probably better off calling OCamlbuild
# or Dune at this stage. Nonetheless, I still show how to compile the generate
# OCaml code with only GNU make and without relying on an external tool or an
# extra dependency analysis.

# First complication... no comment.

# Third complication: F* does not know about our hand-written files. So, we need
# to manually add dependency edges in the graph. In our case, the test driver
# needs all files to be built before. This is convenient because the
# hand-written file only needs to be inserted at the end of the list of CMX
# files. If it had to be inserted somewhere in the middle of the topological
# order, it would be trickier...
