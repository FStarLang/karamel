Low* examples
=============

For the most recent examples, see ``krmllib/LowStar.Lib.*`` where many
"reference" data structures are now being added, including a linked list that's
actually ready for general use in your programs. See also
``test/Wireguard.fst`` for an example of a complex data structure that keeps
pointers to individual cells of a linked list.

For some easier, smaller examples, see the list below. LinkedList4 is a
simplified, earlier version of the reference ``LowStar.Lib.LinkedList``.
