(** CFlat, without structures and with computed stack frames. *)

(** The point of this IR is to:
  * - compute the size of the stack frames;
  * - remove structs and enums, favoring instead n-ary parameters and variables,
  *   along with constant numbers for enums.
  * We keep the size of machine operations, so that we know which sequence of
  * instructions to emit (e.g. for small int types, we want to add a
  * truncation); we also keep the signedness to pick the right operator.
