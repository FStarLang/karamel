     * - Arrays have `buf t` type in Low*; they are referred to exclusively by

     *   definition becomes a Global in WASM and references to them just read
     *   the Global.
     * - Values have non-array types (e.g. a value struct type, integer). When
     *   referred to by their lid, there is a value read.
     *   - For atomic values (e.g. integers), this is trivially compilable as a
     *     Global slot in WASM that is initialized to a constant then read at
     *     reference-time.
     *   - For struct values, we lay them out according to the KaRaMeL layout in
     *     a string. Because of the struct-by-address transformation, these will
     *     only be referred to via the AddressOf operator, meaning that any
     *     &Foo_bar should resolve to the address of the global in the data
     *     segment.
     *     So, for these structs, we lay them out in a string when we hit their
     *     definition, and remember this string in `globals`. Then, any
     *     occurrence of &Foo_bar is replaced in this module with a
     *     StringLiteral. The strings are shared in memory at compile-time, and
     *     hashconsing in CFlatToWasm guarantees that they are shared in the
     *     resulting code, too. *)
