(* New: polymorphic equalities, treated properly, finally (Feb 2021)
   Some background info... initially, equalities were only accepted by KaRaMeL
   at base scalar types (int, bool) that have a "width". However, with time
   passing, KaRaMeL gained the ability to monomorphize functions and therefore
   had to accept equalities on data types, units, and so on. Equalities on base
   types were represented as `Op (Eq, w)` while equalities on complex types were
   represented as `TApp (Op (Eq, <dummy width>), t)` which was clearly
   suboptimal.

   Now, any occurrence of equality is represented as EPolyComp (Eq, t) where t
   can be any type. This allows removing the kludge of dummy values, and also
   allows keeping equalities on types without a width (e.g. an enum) that we
   nonetheless know will be comparable with a target Eq operator.

   For that reason, we keep Eq and Neq in the op type above, even though they
   will with this patch only be used for pretty-printing (like, the comma
   operator). *)
